# Download MP3

Call `mp3.bat` to download a video URL as mp3 into your Music folder.

Either pass a URL, e.g.

	mp3.bat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4

or just call

	mp3.bat

without arguments, in which case the URL is read from the clipboard.


The mp3 files will be saved into your Music folder.
